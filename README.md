ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nasiha Abdella

I am a dedicated 4th-year Computer Science and Engineering student,
actively involved in the CSEC ASTU club. With strong expertise in data
structures, algorithms, and competitive programming, highlighted by my
participation in the 2023 ETCPC competition, I bring a solid technical
foundation. Proficient in frontend development, my skills extend beyond
coding to effective communication, management, and community service.
As I approach graduation, I am eager to apply my diverse skill set and
enthusiasm to contribute to a dynamic work environment.
